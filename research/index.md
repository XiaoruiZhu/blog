### Adaptive Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation

*Adaptive Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation of GARCH Models with Studentâ€™s T Likelihood*

*Abstract:* This paper proposes an adaptive quasi-maximum likelihood estimation when forecasting the volatility of financial data with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity(GARCH) model. When the distribution of volatility data is unspecified or heavy-tailed, we worked out adaptive quasi-maximum likelihood estimation based on data by using the scale parameter \\( \eta_{f} \\) to identify the discrepancy between wrongly specified innovation density and the true innovation density. With only a few assumptions, this adaptive approach is consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, it gains better efficiency under the condition that innovation error is heavy-tailed. Finally, simulation studies and an application show its advantage.
