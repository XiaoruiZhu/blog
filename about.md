This is a personal site of Xiaorui (Jeremy) Zhu, who is a doctoral candidate at the University of Cincinnati, Lindner College of Business. His major is Business Analytics. Before coming to the University of Cincinnati, he received an MS in Finance from Penn State University and a master of applied statistics from Beijing University of Technology.  

My research interests include high dimensional statistics, machine learning, finance, relevant applications, and creativity. In high-dimensional statistics, I study the variable selection methods and the post-selection inference. One of my works proposed the sparsified simultaneous confidence intervals for the high-dimensional linear regression model (<a href="" style="color:blue" target="_blank"> <b>SSCI</b> </a>). In machine learning, I study robust estimation methods when data have missing values or contaminations. In finance, I work on volatility models and bankruptcy problems. In a published work, I proposed an adaptive method to estimate the coefficients of the GARCH model with heavy-tailed innovation. For the bankruptcy problem, I am interested in the prediction of bankruptcy. One of my projects focuses on the relationship between bankruptcy risk and stock returns. How creativity can stimulate the development of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence always arouse my interest. 
                                    
He believes that stay Hungry, stay Foolish, and stay Creative is the secret to success. And he dreams of being able to create meaningful things that will benefit the general public.
