## To allow ubuntu write access to specific directory

Make sure permissions on that entire folder were correct:

## Next is develop Shiny application on the server

Using GitHub is the best way. Each time after I created a shiny app, first, I should push my app to github "shiny-server" respository. Second, login to EC2 instance and use "git pull" in the "shiny-server" directory so that all those apps will be updated. Then those app will running in the shiny server. 

## Installing R packages in the shiny server.

sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('devtools', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')\""
