Yesterday is the first year anniversary of my marriage. We've been in love over seven years. We had some many happy time together and been through several hard tests. We kept long-distance love over two years when we were pursuing our master degree respectively. The distance between us is about 6740 miles or 10844.66 Kilometers. We made it. Our hearts stayed together. Then, from Pennsylvania to Ohio, from Malvern to Columbus, we got together with happiness, we separated with miss. Right now, we are living together. We decide what we will cook, what we want to buy, when we should go to school. We discuss dream, statistics, ideas. We are becoming the specific person who we dream from the very beginning. Or, we are trying to be the one that we want.
