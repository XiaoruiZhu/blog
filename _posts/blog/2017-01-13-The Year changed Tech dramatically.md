# Several big innovations that benefit you most

When you talk about the new Netflex series "House of Cards" on your Iphone 7 plus in you left hand, you may find more and more people on the street are using fancy Android mobile phone which makes you worry about whether the next generation of Iphone is worth to buy. Likewise, some easily missed technologies that benefits you a lot such as AWS, Prime Video also initiated in the same year, 2007. You may get used to them today and think that they are necessary parts of your daily life. But before 2007, they all are bound by network infrastructure. Things are totally changed due to network upgrade and launch of App Store. 

It's intuitive to think that expansion of statistical learning algorithms and computational power will definitely promote next upheaval in human society. The popularity of AI is based on mathmatics, statistical methods but not limit to those narrow nature sciences which we know for centuries. Without the healthy developing of these "next generation infrastructure", just think it as body with computational power as energy but no sapiential brain, AI, VR, Google Brain, Smart City wouldn't come true. All human knowledge as a whole will be evolved to break the boundries that we think they are, no matter good or bad. The nature selection over the past billions years was only led by randomly utilizing process for optimal specie or just live or die. The developing of AI will definitely dwarf this complicated but not sole evolution path. The rule and the destination is rooted into the whole design of the fate of AI. Evil idea leads to releasing of demons, whereas optimizing human knowledge could lead to a world with sophisticated but elegant knowledge object.
